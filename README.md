## General info
---
This project was introduced to introduce multiple challenges:
* Continue our introduction to React
* Demonstrate how to separate React components
* Demonstrate parent/child elements in React
* Use stylesheets with React

I completed this by following along in Week 14 exercise videos. I did exactly what the instructor did, the only part I did on my own was the styles.
